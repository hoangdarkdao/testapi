    Problem:
        Given an instance of the Aircraft Landing Scheduling Problem, schedule the landing time for each plane and assign a runway so that:
          - Each landing time is within its allowed time window.
          - Each plane is assigned to one runway (from the available runways).
          - For any two planes assigned to the same runway, if plane i lands at or before plane j, then the landing times must be separated by at least
            the specified separation time (provided in the input data).
          - The overall penalty is minimized. For each plane, if its landing time is earlier than its target time, a penalty
            is incurred proportional to the earliness; if later than its target time, a penalty proportional to the lateness is incurred.
          - If any constraint is violated, the solution receives no score.
    Input kwargs:
        num_planes  : (int) Number of planes.
        num_runways : (int) Number of runways.
        freeze_time : (float) Freeze time (unused in scheduling decisions).
        planes      : (list of dict) Each dictionary contains:
                        - "appearance"    : float, time the plane appears.
                        - "earliest"      : float, earliest landing time.
                        - "target"        : float, target landing time.
                        - "latest"        : float, latest landing time.
                        - "penalty_early" : float, penalty per unit time landing early.
                        - "penalty_late"  : float, penalty per unit time landing late.
        separation  : (list of lists) separation[i][j] is the required gap after plane i lands before plane j can land
                      when they are assigned to the same runway.
    Returns:
        A dictionary named "schedule" mapping each plane id (1-indexed) to a dictionary with its scheduled landing time
        and assigned runway, e.g., { plane_id: {"landing_time": float, "runway": int}, ... }.

    # -----------------------
    # For demonstration purposes, we simply schedule each plane at its target time
    # and assign all planes to runway 1.
    # (Note: This solution may be infeasible if targets do not satisfy separation constraints.)

task_description = ("The problem is to schedule landing times for a set of planes across one or more runways such that "
                    "each landing occurs within its prescribed time window and all pairwise separation requirements "
                    "are satisfied; specifically, if plane i lands at or before plane j on the same runway, "
