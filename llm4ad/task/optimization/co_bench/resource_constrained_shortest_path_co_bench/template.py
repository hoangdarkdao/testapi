    Solve the Resource Constrained Shortest Path problem.
    Input kwargs should include:
      - n (int): number of vertices,
      - m (int): number of arcs,
      - K (int): number of resources,
      - lower_bounds (list of float): list of lower limits for each resource,
      - upper_bounds (list of float): list of upper limits for each resource,
      - vertex_resources (list of list of float): list (of length n) of lists (of length K) with the resource consumption at each vertex,
      - graph (dict): dictionary mapping each vertex (1-indexed) to a list of arcs, where each arc is a tuple
                      (end_vertex (int), cost (float), [arc resource consumptions] (list of float)).
    Evaluation Metric:
      If the computed path is valid (i.e. it starts at vertex 1, ends at vertex n, every transition is
      defined in the graph, and the total resource consumption from both vertices and arcs is within the
      specified bounds for each resource), then the score equals the total arc cost along the path.
      Otherwise, the solution is invalid and receives no score.
    Returns:
      A dictionary with keys:
         "total_cost": total cost (a float) of the computed path,
         "path": a list of vertex indices (integers) defining the path.
    (Placeholder implementation)

    # Placeholder implementation.
    n = kwargs.get("n", 1)
    # Return a trivial solution: just go directly from vertex 1 to vertex n.
    return {"total_cost": 0.0, "path": [1, n]}

task_description = ("This problem involves finding the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n in a directed graph "
