                         with no intermediate depot visits.
        The evaluator checks the following:
          1. For each customer (other than the depot), verifies that there is a chosen schedule,
             and that the chosen schedule is one of that customer's candidate schedules.
          2. For each day:
               - Verifies that the number of tours does not exceed the available vehicles for that day.
               - Checks that every customer whose chosen schedule requires service is visited exactly once.
          3. Each tour must:
               - Start at the depot (id 0) and end at the depot (id 0).
               - Not include any depot visit in the middle (the depot may appear only as the first and the last vertex).
               - Not visit the same customer more than once.
          4. Each tour must satisfy the capacity constraint: the total customer demand on the tour does not exceed vehicle_capacity.
          5. Finally, the evaluator computes the total tour length (using Euclidean distance) over all days.
        Returns:
          A numeric value representing the total tour length computed from the solution.
