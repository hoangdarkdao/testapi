# Welcome to LLM4AD's Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on the [contributors list](#contributors) :sparkles:.

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a Pull Request (PR), reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read LLM4AD's [README](https://github.com/Optima-CityU/llm4ad?tab=readme-ov-file#readme). For additional information, check out the [LLM4AD documentation](https://llm4ad-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

### 1. Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you spot a problem with LLM4AD, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/Optima-CityU/llm4ad/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Optima-CityU/llm4ad/issues/new/choose). Please report issue with your system version, Python version, running script and error log, etc.

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Optima-CityU/llm4ad/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](https://api-chat.bltcy.cn/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### 2. Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.

- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2) Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### 3. Commit Your Update

Once you are happy with your changes, run `black .` to apply [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formatting to your local version. Commit the changes once you are ready.

### 4. Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a LLM4AD team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, check out this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
